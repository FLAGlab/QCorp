# QCorp
Corpus of Q-learning projects for tool analysis and testing.

## Structure
This repository contains Reinforcement Learning (RL) programs for both tabular and continuous RL implementations. The tabular examples implement three different applications coming from developers participating in an university course.

| Program      | Implementation instances |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Gridworld      | 20       |
| Rooms   | 23        |
| Taxi   | 23        |

The continuous examples are extracted from GitHub, chosen from the RL Leaderboard (https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/Leaderboard)
| Program      | Implementation instances |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Cartpole      | 18       |
| Mountain car   | 8        |
| Pendulum   | 5        |


Each of the programs within an application are anonymized and enumerated. The data related to the analysis of the VAR Check tool, which includes the python implementation instances of the programs, the generated visualization for the corresponding implementation, and the raw dataextracted from the tool's execution. All files follow the same naming convention using the corresponding id for the implementation.
