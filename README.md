# QCorp
Corpus of Q-learning projects for tool analysis and testing.

## Structure
This repository contains Reinforcement Learning (RL) programs from three different domains
| Program      | Implementation instances |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Gridworld      | 20       |
| Rooms   | 23        |
| Taxi   | 23        |

Each of the programs within a domain currently contains the programs (anonymized and enumerated), the data related to the analysis of the VAR Check tool, which includes the python implementation instances of the programs, the generated visualization for the corresponding implementation, and the raw dataextracted from the tool's execution. All files follow the same naming convention using the corresponding id for the implementation.
